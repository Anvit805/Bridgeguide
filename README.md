# Bridgeguide
A project that helps students their subjects in cambridge board according to their interests, convenience. No outside frameworks were used to code this site: it simply employed HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The style, which you’ll find throughout the code, encourages a non-technical person to understand it and is devoid of any fancy shorthand. For instance, variables are named clearly, and code is written in an easy sequence rather than being squeezed into single lines. The recommendation engine mimics the workings of a rule-based system: the student’s career interests, university conditions, and subject capacities are evaluated using simple conditional statements (if-else and switch) for tailored recommendations. All subjects are kept in arrays, and straightforward methods like filter, map, and includes are used for amendment or retrieval. The handling of English subjects is special and demands additional checks to ensure the student gets just one mandatory English subject tailored to her needs. The layout is formed using appropriate HTML forms and is styled with CSS flexbox, which allows elements to be properly aligned, thus maintaining a neat and adaptable front end. In general, the way the system works, along with the syntax and structure, is very intuitive and natural, which is very helpful when digesting or expanding on the code.
